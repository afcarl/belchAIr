# BelchAIr project

The belchAIr project is a project to facilitate a learning environment for goldfishing the Belcher deck. The environment is almost ready, the bots not yet. Currently there are a number of discrepancies with real life goldfish Belcher and the current implementation.

## Discrepancies:

- You cannot sacrifice Lion's Eye Diamond as an instant, which means that it becomes a lot worse
- Manamorphose costs 1R instead of 1R or 1G
- You cannot mulligan yet
- You cannot cast the Spirit Guides yet
- Chrome Mox currently has to exile a card but makes all the colors once in play
- Gitaxian Probe can only be cast for life

## TODO:

- Check after every action if the game is finished
- Implement different reward functions that return after the game is finished
